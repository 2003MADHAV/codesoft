Network Intrusion Detection (NID) is a cybersecurity mechanism designed to identify and respond to unauthorized access or activities within a computer network. The goal is to detect and prevent various forms of cyber threats, including hacking attempts, malicious activities, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. NID systems play a crucial role in ensuring the security and integrity of networked systems.

Here are key concepts and components related to Network Intrusion Detection:

Intrusion Detection System (IDS):

Host-Based IDS (HIDS): Monitors activities on individual devices, such as computers or servers.
Network-Based IDS (NIDS): Analyzes network traffic to identify suspicious patterns or behaviors.
Detection Techniques:

Signature-Based Detection: Uses predefined patterns or signatures of known threats to identify malicious activities.
Anomaly-Based Detection: Establishes a baseline of normal behavior and alerts on deviations from the baseline, which may indicate an intrusion.
Heuristic-Based Detection: Utilizes rules and algorithms to identify potential threats based on behaviors that might not match specific signatures.
Types of Attacks Detected:

Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks: Overwhelm network resources to disrupt services.
Malware and Virus Attacks: Detection of malicious software attempting to compromise systems.
Intrusion Attempts: Identification of unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities.
Network Scanning: Detection of activities associated with mapping or probing the network.
Incident Response:

Alerts and Notifications: When the IDS identifies a potential threat, it generates alerts or notifications for security personnel.
Logging and Analysis: Detailed logs are maintained for analysis, forensic investigation, and compliance purposes.
False Positives and False Negatives:

False Positives: When the system incorrectly identifies normal behavior as malicious, leading to unnecessary alerts.
False Negatives: Failure to detect actual malicious activities, allowing an intrusion to go undetected.
Adaptive and Machine Learning:

Advanced NID systems often incorporate machine learning and adaptive techniques to continuously improve their ability to detect new and evolving threats.
Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):

While NID focuses on detection and alerting, Intrusion Prevention Systems go a step further by actively blocking or mitigating identified threats.
Open Source and Commercial Solutions:

Various open-source and commercial NID solutions are available, offering different features and capabilities.
Network Intrusion Detection is an essential component of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, helping organizations proactively identify and respond to potential security threats. It plays a vital role in safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of networked systems and data.
